# Udacity - Machine Learning Nanodegree

Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree project files and lecture notes.

This repository contains project files and lecture notes for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program which I started working on in March 2018.


## Lecture note reference

### Model evaluation and validation

**Topics covered in this section:**

- **Model Evaluation**  
  Confusion matrix, F1 score, F-beta score, ROC curve
- **Model selection**  
  Types of errors, various types of cross validation, learning curves, grid search

**See lecture notes:** [here](1_evaluation_and_validation.pdf)

### Supervised learning

**Topics covered in this section:**

- **Linear regression**  
  Absolute trick, advantages / disadvantages, L1 regularisation, L2 regularisation
- **Decision trees**  
  Entropy, information gain, hyperparameters
- **Naive bayes**  
  Prior probability, posterior probability, naive bayes
- **Support vector machines**  
  Idea, different types of errors, basic working principle, etc.
