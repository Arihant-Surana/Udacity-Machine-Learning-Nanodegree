# Naive Bayes

## Bayes Theorem

Incorporates knowledge of an event. It switches from what we know to what we infer.

Let's say we know the probability of an event P(A) and the propability of an event P(R|A). P(R|A) is related to A. <br/>
Bayes Theorem infers the probability of A given R. This is the new probability of A once we know that the event R has occured.

**Prior Probability** <br/>
Probability of an event without additional knowledge. <br/>
"What we knew before we knew that R occured."

**Posterior Probability** <br/>
Probability of an event after inferring the additional knowledge. <br/>
"What we inferred after we knew that R occured."
